# IE221 – TeamWork 3 (Group 07)

## Project Description
This project is prepared for IE221 – Probability course.
The objective is to experimentally verify:
- Strong Law of Large Numbers (SLLN)
- Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
- A practical application of SLLN using Monte Carlo π estimation

All simulations are implemented in Python.
